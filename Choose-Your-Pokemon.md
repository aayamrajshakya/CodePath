## U-nderstand
 
> **Understand** what the interviewer is asking for by using test cases and questions about the problem.

- When we call the function, what will the input parameter be used for?
  - It is a list of strings to loop over and add to the print statement.

## P-lan

> **Plan** the solution with appropriate visualizations and pseudocode.

**General Idea:** Call the function with the input of strings to print out sequentially.

```markdown
1) Determine the list of strings we want to print in front of " I choose you!"
2) Call the function with that list of strings as the input
```

## I-mplement

```python
i_choose_you(["Pikachu", "Charizard", "Eevee")
```
