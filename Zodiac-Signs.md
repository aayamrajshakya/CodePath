*[[Unit 5 Session 1]] (Click for link to problem statements)*

## U-nderstand
 
> **Understand** what the interviewer is asking for by using test cases and questions about the problem.

- What is the correct order of the nodes in the linked list according to the given list?
  - The nodes must be connected in the order: "aries", "taurus", "gemini", "cancer".

## P-lan

> **Plan** the solution with appropriate visualizations and pseudocode.

**General Idea:** Sequentially link nodes representing the elements "aries", "taurus", "gemini", and "cancer" to form a linked list.

```markdown
1) Create a node for each element in the given list and assign each to a variable (head, second, third, tail).
2) Link each node to the next using the `next` attribute to form a sequence:
  - Link `head` (aries) to `second` (taurus).
  - Link `second` to `third` (gemini).
  - Link `third` to `tail` (cancer).
```

**⚠️ Common Mistakes**

- Incorrectly linking nodes, which could lead to nodes being out of the intended order.
- Failing to link the last node (cancer), which would result in an incomplete list.

## I-mplement

```python
head = Node('aries')
second = Node('taurus')
third = Node('gemini')
tail = Node('cancer')

head.next = second
second.next = third
third.next = tail
```
